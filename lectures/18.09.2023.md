# Lecture 7
# Multiple sequence alignment


### Problem
Align more then two seq in such a way that max numberof residues from each seq are matches

Align all coloumns and sequences!, reconstruct the best multiple seq alignment

Example. sq1,sq2,s3

maybe sq1 and sq2 are good but sq3 maybe dont fit so well


## How do we solve this?

### Sum of pairs scores

**We use the subsitution/scoring matrix**

Match = 1
Mismatch = -1
Gap = -2
Gap/Gap = 0

**Sum of pairs scores**

<p> A  A  T   - </p>
<p> A  A  C   - </p>
<p> A  A  C   T </p>

3  3  1  -4 = **+1**

OR

<p> A  A  -  T </p>
<p> A  A  C  - </p>
<p> A  C  C  T </p>
<p> 3  3  -3 -3 = **0** </p>


### Entropy score

**Measure degree of randomness in each of the coloumns**

![entropy](images/entropy.png)

Count how many seq the alignments agree

<p> 1  2  3   4 </p>
<p> A  A  T   - </p>
<p> A  A  C   - </p>
<p> A  A  C   T </p>

- Col 1:
1*log(1) = 0

- Col 2:
1*log(1) = 0

- Col 3: 
<p> We see T once, while C two times </p>
<p>    T ------------------ C          </p>
(1/3log(1/3)) - (2/3log(2/3))


- Col 4: 
<p> (1/3log(1/3)) - (2/3log(2/3)) </p>


### Dynamic programming

<p>  - A A C </p>
<p> -0-2 -4-8 </p>
<p> A-2 0 </p>
<p> A-4 </p>
<p> T-8 </p>

But in 3d!

Every cell in the cube represents one coloum in the 3d cube

When we rate a score, look at all directions, X/Y/Z

If its 3d cube, comes from 7 directions

(2^num_of_sequences) -1

Too many sequences -> way too impractical

Cannot do dynamic programming -> too many sequences and lengths
