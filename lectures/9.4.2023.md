NGS/RNA-seq

nex-generation seq


## Origins of dna seq

### why
- medicine ->  genetic variation/rare disease/viruses
- biology genotype to phenotype
- crops 

### sanger
- sanger guy was first dude to do dna seq
- used chain termingating inhibs (sanger seq)

### how do we do sang sequencing
- uses automated seq machines
1. dna is fragmented
2. dna polymrase amplified
3. dNTP's are added and build upon fragments, (for each 4 bases)
4. ddNTP's is also added, and terminates the fragments
5. using gel you can read the bases -> light will correspond to sequence

## NGS is new and cool, millions of sequences

### illumina method

- several lanes
- bind to flow cell
- clonal amplification
- creates bridges
- dna polymerase amplifies and creates dna fragment clusters
- ddntps with flourofour attatched -> light emmison is read from microscope 
- then we gotta assemble this stuff

accurate, fast, robust
*but...* cant read more than 150bp

### pacbio sequence
- single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT)

up to 70kb
no PCR bias

high error rate (compared to the rest)
high cost
no amplifications so need a lot of input material

### nanopore seq

- dna helix is unwound
- dna is fed thru a pore
- there is electric charge in memrbane
- when the dna goes thru, electric charge changes
- change measured and relates to a specific sequence

### ngs important stuff

read length
errors
library type
cost
turnaround time
multiplexing?

### read length
illumina 150kb
pacbio minION 50kb

short are good for re-sequencing
longer reads, LTR, chromosomal reargments

### errors
- there is a lot of error percents
- nanopore is error prone
- illumina is pretty good
- error correcting is a thing

### multiplexing

using an illumina flowcell, can create a barcode

### refrence genome
what would we expect from a genome, can map from it


## RNA

### Transciprtome
- represents all the RNA expressed
- genomes are stable, but transcriptome changes
- transciprtome is linked to which genes which are expressed

### why rna
- medicine -> gene expression, tumors, disease linked to rna
- biology -> gene expression linked to cell type, embryonic development etc

### mRNA transcription

- exon is whats important
- introns is not transcribed
