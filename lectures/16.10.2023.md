# Lecture 
# Introduction to protein structures and relevant databases

# hey its mark! hey mark 

mother with diabetes, baby grow a lot

which means baby more disease! hmm weird

some babies dont make insulin, damn what we gonna do

help em

so far its just cell and protein

ok carbs and lipids are a thing cool

dna has primary,sec,tert,quart structure

two cystines can build bridges, di-sulphide bonds !!! 

connect two proteins to make insulin for example

## Next part

Go to CLINVAR to see if a mutation is pathogenic 

gTex -> 

uniprot -> all data

nextprot -> only for humans

human protein atlas -> see where proteins are expressed 

proteomicsDB -> mass spectomtry database

phosphoSitePlus -> see struct.mod for proteins

Protein Data Bank -> database with every structure that has been published

Also ALPHAFOLD is sick too 

STRING -> Do proteins interact?

Reactome -> biological pathways 

ENSABMLE is good too

**be mindful about cultural stuff** 

most people who make data are just northern eruopeans, but most people are not northern europeans
