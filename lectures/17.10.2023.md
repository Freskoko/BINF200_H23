# Oh hey its mark again! cool french guy

just recap

hydrophillic and hydrophobic -> amphiphatic

naked protiens -> glycans / phopsorrylation make them fluffy not naked

FOR PROTEINS

phopsrylation - cell signal

glycocylation - receptors

acetylation - needs to be moved

ubiqutnaion - mark for removal/recycled

### a little more into amino acids

amino group and carboxylic group, also side chain (R-group)

amin oacid covalent bond



start N-terminus

end C-terminus

NCCNCCNCCNCC

carbon alpha chain can rotate

**alpha**

makes alpha helxi and beta sheet 

3.6 amino acid per turn

for one pitch, moves 54 Ã…


**beta**

parallel or antiparallel

### ramachandran plot !!

phi vs si rotation in alpha helix

just know what it is


### atlas of protein and structure

first bioinformatics pub

basiclaly old uniprot
