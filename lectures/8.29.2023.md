# Lecture 4

## 1 Biological databases
***we use db to find sequences***

given a query sequence, go to database and find matching or similar 

examples:
- nucleic acid research 
- genbank
- uniprot --> tells us important stuff about proteins

DB search is tricky


## 2 BLAST

Simplified SW - alignment fast and easy to access
Estimates only part of the search space
BLAST restricsts search by a quick inital scan, before doing more intense alignments
BLAST is not gauranteed!!

- algorithm
Make a list of query word pairs

Expand word pairs -> create similar words to the query words

DB is scanned to find seq entries that match compiled word list

![blast sequence](images/blast_seq.png)


example:

1. Setup grams

q: ACGTAC

2-grams: AC, CG, GT, TA , AC

similarity matrix alphabet:

  A   C   G   T
A 2  -2   1  -2
C     2  -2  1
G         2  -2
T            2

Match is 2 points, mismatch points varies 
some mismatch are worse

2. Score segment pairs and matching n-grams


N-gram Matching    Score
AC      AA          = 0
AC      AC          = 4
etc...

Good score = correct alignment

There is a threshold score, example 3

Then we only want the matching ones

N-gram   Match   Scores
AC     AC,AT,GC  4,3,3

Repeat for all N-grams

3. Create lookup table

N-gram-match  Indicies of Q    Score
AC                  1,5         4,4 
GC                  1,3,5       3,3,3

^This GC tells us that we can have a GC where our query has an AC, but it will only have 3, not 4
AC in index 1 is a max score of 4! Very good 

4. Scan DB, to find matching that reaches across threshold

AAAGTG

GT index 3, score 4
TG index 2,4 score 3,3

Potential GT match at index 3
Potential TG match at index 2 and 4

 AAAGTG
AAATGG
  AAATGG

5. We are going to have a lot of possible matches! --> 

If we already have an identical hit then yippi

else,

find similar regions and prioritize regions with matches which are close genetically, increase their score, 
and decrease score of regions with less matches


### When we add a new sequence?
We also add its n-grams

CTGA is added
then 
1. CT
2. TG

is also stored, so that you dont need to process these things a million times
the indexes will always be the same

so we bascially go right to step 3



- statistics
- output
